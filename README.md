# Simple Interest Calculator

## Description
This project is a simple interest calculator that computes the simple interest
based on user-provided values for principal amount, rate of interest, and time
period. It is designed as a basic example to demonstrate version control,
open-source collaboration practices, and scripting using Bash.

## What is Simple Interest?
Simple Interest is calculated on the original principal amount for the entire
duration of the loan or investment. It does not compound over time.

## Formula
The formula used to calculate simple interest is:

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

Where:
- Principal is the initial amount of money
- Rate is the rate of interest per year
- Time is the time period in years

## How It Works
1. The user is prompted to enter the principal amount.
2. The user enters the rate of interest.
3. The user enters the time period in years.
4. The script calculates the simple interest using the formula.
5. The calculated simple interest is displayed to the user.

## Example
If the principal amount is 1000, the rate of interest is 5%, and the time period
is 2 years, then:

Simple Interest = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100
